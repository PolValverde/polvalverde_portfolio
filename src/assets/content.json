            "Interferències is an immersive installation that transforms the invisible electromagnetic waves around us into a perceptible sound and light landscape. The beacons capture signals from sources like antennas, radios, or mobile devices, converting them into sound and light in real-time. Each visit is unique due to the constant interaction with the environment and visitors' devices, which can alter the landscape by generating interferences. This piece invites exploration of the invisible electromagnetic dimensions that underpin our world.",
